Dr. Eric Thomas said that our dreams are in our DNA. I heard him say this as I was in the process of realizing my own dream. I realized that my family was one full of teachers and educators, and that I was fighting the urge to become one myself. I would come up with all kinds of excuses like how I didn’t trust people, or how I didn’t like talking to people or audiences. The truth is that I never really tried. I never gave it a full effort, and I sold myself short. That ends today. I’m putting content out for the world to see as I become what is literally in my blood. As I face and fight against what is holding me back…my own thoughts. See you soon…
